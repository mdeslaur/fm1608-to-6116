# FM1608 to 6116 ram adapter

This is a small adapter board to use inexpensive DIP FM1608 FRAM memory
chip in games that require a 6116 static ram to save ram contents during
power off so a battery is no longer required.

For example, it can be used in Williams pinball System 11 games, or in
Midway MCR games such as Tron.

A 10k surface mount resistor is required for MCR games.

Gerbers for JLCPCB are located in the gerbers directory.
A PDF of the schematic and a 3d render are located in the Docs directory.
